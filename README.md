# RTL-Design-with-Verilog-
üî∑**Key Features of Verilog:**

‚û§Used for digital design and verification

‚û§Supports multiple modeling styles: gate-level, dataflow, behavioral, and structural

‚û§Can simulate, synthesize, and implement digital hardware on FPGAs and ASICs

Verilog is IEEE standardized (IEEE 1364) and widely adopted in the semiconductor and VLSI design industry.

üî∑**What is RTL Design?**

RTL (Register Transfer Level) is a design abstraction that defines how data flows between registers and the logical operations performed on that data.

At the RTL level:

‚û§Registers store data using flip-flops or latches.

‚û§Combinational logic performs operations (e.g., addition, shifting, logical comparison).

‚û§Designs are written using sequential and combinational logic constructs in HDL (like Verilog).


  **RTL design** is the first and most critical step in digital hardware design and synthesis. It is used for:

‚û§Functional simulation

‚û§Synthesis into gate-level netlists for FPGA or ASIC design

‚û§Timing analysis and hardware implementation
